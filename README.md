# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the Project
>PlanMyTrip a top travel technology company requested a data analysis to collect and present data for customers, in which we can filter based on current travel criteria in order to find the ideal hotel.  By conducting a basic project plan, we outlined the purpose, task and method. The basic plan was able to help us to demonstrate: 
1.	Analysis and collecting data of cities across the world.
2.	Recommending ideal hotels with weather preferences.
3.	Utilizing the Pandas DataFrame to the make the data easy to read and alter as needed.

# Weather data
We generated a set of 2000 random latitudes and longitudes cities. We used the API to preform thus task called OpenWeatherMap.
The following data was retrieved from the JSON to a DataFrame.
1.	Maximun temperature
2.	Latitudes and Longitude
3.	Wind Speed
4.	Percent humidity
5.	Percent cloudiness
6.	Current weather description

Analysis with Visualization 

We created scatter plots, correlations and heatmaps by using Google Maps and API to showcase weather data:

# Conclusion 
Base of the data we were able to demonstrate all and more with the data collected. As the data is interchangeable for future references.
